#### Github Codespaces Workflow

To merge changes from your GitHub Codespaces into your local version, you'll first need to commit and push the changes to your codespaces's remote repository, then fetch and merge those changes into your local repository.

#### Here's a breadown:

1. Inside your Codespaces:

- Commit Changes:

    Use the source control tools (like the VS Code integrated terminal or the Source Control view) to stage and commit your changes. Make sure to create a meaningful commit message.

- Push Changes:

    Push your committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub. If you are working on a branch other than the main branch, push the changes to the remote branch.

2. Locally (on your computer)

1. Inside your CodespaceL

* `git add .` (stage all changes)

* `git commit -m "My Codespaces Changes"` (create a commit)

* `git push origin <branch_name>` (push to remote) (replace <branch_name> with your branch)

2. Locally:

* `git pull origin <branch_name>` (or `git fetch` + `git merge`)

* If conflicts, address them and `git add .`,`git commit`, and `git push`
