a `compose.yaml` files defines a single service 'app' which represents a Node.js development environment. When you run `docker compose up`, Docker Compose will:

1. Build an image: Build a Docker image using the `Dockerfile` in the same directory as the `compose.yaml` file.

2. Create a container: Create a container from that image.

3. Map Ports: Map port 3000 on your list machine to port 3000 in the container, making the application accessible from your web broswer.

4. Mount a volumne: Mount your project directory into the contain's `/app` directory, allowing for hot reloading

5. Run a command: Run the `npm run dev` command inside the container, starting your development server.

6. Override Dockerfile: if there was a `CMD` in the Dockerfile, it is ignored, and `npm run dev` is used instead.
