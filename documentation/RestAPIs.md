REST APIs

Client - Server

- We generally want to store data on the server

- This allows data to be shared reliably between site users

- Also allows reliable data persistence

- But how do we have the data on the back-end and still manage that data from the front-end?

- A REST API is a standardized interface for the client to manage data on the server

- Sort of like how humans have standardized expectations for making phone calls.
