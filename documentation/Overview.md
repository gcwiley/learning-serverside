## MongoDB Overview

## MongoDB Atlas

MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database developed by the same people that build MongoDB. Atlas handles all the complexity of deployment, managing, and healing your deployments on the cloud service provider of your choice (AWS, Azure, and GCP).

## MongoDB Compass

MongoDB Compass is the GUI for MongoDB. Compass allows you to analyze and understand the contents of your data without formal knowledge of MongoDB query syntax. In addition to exploring your data in a visual environment, you can also use Compass to optimize query performance, manage indexes, and implement document validation.
