Deploying your web application to Google App Engine involves a few key steps. The process is streamlined because App Engine is a managed platform, allowing you to focus on your code.

Here is a general outline of the steps

1. `Prepare Your Application`:

   -  Develop your web application: Write your code in one of App Engine's supported languages(Python, Java, Node.js, PHP, Go, Ruby, .NET)

   -  `Create a app.yaml file`: This is a configuration file that tells App Engine how to run your application, including it runtime environment, handlers for URLs, static files, and other setting. This file is crucial for App Engine to understand and deploy your app correctly.

   -  `Ensure necessary dependencies`: If your application uses libraries or frameworks, make sure they are properly declared (e.g. requirements.txt for Python, package.json for Node.js)

2. `Set up Your Google Cloud Project`

   -  `Create a Google Cloud Project`: If you don't already have one, create a new project in the Google Cloud Console. This project will house your App Engine application and associated resources.

   -  `Enable the App Engine API`: Within your project, ensure the App Engine Admin API is enabled.

   -  `Create an App Engine application within your project`: This is a one-time setup per project. You'll specify the region where your App Engine application will reside. You can do this through the Google Cloud Console or via the `gcloud` command-line tool.

3. `Install the Configure Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI)`:

   -  `Download and install`: If you haven't already, install the Google Cloud SDK on your local machine. This SDK provides the `gcloud` command-line tool, which you'll use for deployment.

   -  `Initialize and authenticate`: Run `gcloud init` to authenticate with your Google Cloud account and select the Google Cloud project you wish to deploy to.

4. `Deploy Your Application`

   -  `Navigate to your application's root directory`: Open your terminal or command prompt and change the directory to the root of your application, where your `app.yaml` file is located.

   -  `Run the deploy command`: Execute the `gcloud app deploy` command:

      -  You might be prompted to select a region if you haven't already created an App Engine application in your project.

      -  You can include optional flags like `-- version` to specify a unique ID for your deployment, or `-- project` to explicity target a different project.

   -  `Confirm deployment`: The `gcloud` tool will show you a summary of what will be deployed. Confirm by typing `Y` when prompted.

5. `Verify Deployment and Access Your Application`

   -  Once the deployment is complete, `gcloud` will provide you with the URL of your deployed application.

   -  You can also use the `gcloud app browse` command to open your application in a web browser.

   -  Monitor logs and preformance through the Google Cloud Console's App Engine Section.
