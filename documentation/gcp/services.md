#### What is Google App Engine (GAE)

Google App Engine (GAE) is a fully managed serverless platform that allows developers to build, deploy, and host web applications and mobile backends on Google Cloud. It's designed to simplify application development by abstracting away the underlying infrastructure. 

Here is a breakdown of what that means. 

- `Platform as a Service (Paas)`: App Engine provides a complete environment for your application, including the operating system, web server, and application runtime. You can focus on your code, and Google manages the rest. 

- `Serverless`: With App Engine, you don't provision or manage servers. Google automatically handles the infrastructure, including scaling your application from zero to millions of users based on demand. You only pay for the resources you application comsumes.

- `Automatic Scaling`: App Engine is built to scale application automatically in response to traffic. If your application experiences a sudden surge in users, App Engine can automatically allocate more resources to handle the load. Conversely, it can scale down when traffic decreases. 

- `Build on Services`: It offers a suite of pre-integrated services and APIs commonly needed by web and mobile applications. These include NoSQL databases (like Datastore and Firestore), memcache or caching, user authentication APIs, and more

- `Language Support`: App Engine supports popular programming languages such as Python, Java, Node.js, PHP, Go, Ruby, and .NET. This allows developers to work with thier preferred languages and frameworks. 

- `Focus on Code`: By handling infrastructure management, App Engine lets developers concentrate on writing application code and building features, rather than worrying about server provisioning, maintenance, or patching. 

In essence, `App Engine` is a powerful tool for developers who want to deploy scalable web and mobile applications quickly and efficiently without getting bogged down by infrastructure complexities.
